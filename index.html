	<p>Learning how to script 
  	 	with AppleScript is ideal as an  
  	 	introduction to programming. 
  	 It leaves out most of the nitty-gritty work 
  	 a programmer in a computer
  	  language such as Java has
  	  to do before she can even perform the easiest of tasks. <br>
  	AppleScript is easy enough that a 10 year old can learn it,
  	 yet so powerful that professionals enjoy it too. 
  That leaves plenty of room for growth for you.<br>
   While not covered in this book,
    you can even use AppleScript to 
    build computer programs that
    look and work just like 
    the commercial programs you use on your Mac,
     with buttons, menus, scrollbars and all.
     This requires AppleScript Studio,
      provided for free
